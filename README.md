# StringsInBinarySearchTrees
This program receives a text file in the command line 
	arguments. it will insert the lines of the files into a binary search tree.
	if there is a -c flag then it is case sensitive, otherwise its not case 
	sensitive. if there is -o flag with its argument, it means it will write the
	tree into the file in an inorder fashion. if there is no -o flag, then the
	output is in stdout. if there is no file then the input comes from stdin.
